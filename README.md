## About Kaggle competition:
In this competition, your task is to predict engagement with a pet's profile based on the photograph for that profile. You are also provided with hand-labelled metadata for each photo. The dataset for this competition therefore comprises both images and tabular data.

## How Pawpularity Score Is Derived
* The Pawpularity Score is derived from each pet profile's page view statistics at the listing pages, using an algorithm that normalizes the traffic data across different pages, platforms (web & mobile) and various metrics.
* Duplicate clicks, crawler bot accesses and sponsored profiles are excluded from the analysis.

## About the team:
We are working on this competition as a part of Machine learning class project. Our objective is to learn and develop our understanding of Vision transformers, and doing regression and classification on image data.
